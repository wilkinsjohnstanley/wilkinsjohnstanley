# 👋 Hi, I'm John Wilkins!

## 💻 About Me
I am a fresh graduate with a Masters degree in Computer Science who volunteers with Team Fusion 364 robotics team. I have international experience from teaching English in Japan for four years. I volunteered after school to coach students who went on to win English speaking contests and competitions. I have equal amounts of soft skills relating to working on teams and technical prowess from my education and experience with the robotics team as a Java programming mentor.
Through these various projects I have gained helpful knowledge of embedded systems and electronic circuits. I have excellent written and verbal skills.
I am also confident that my soft skills through most recently becoming a robotics mentor demonstrates that I am a trustworthy person of integrity. As a middle school teacher for Japanese children as well I maintained positive relationships with teachers at multiple schools, evidenced by my contract being renewed 3 times after the first year of working.
